# isUnique

### Description
This repository holds my submission to an assignment for SDEV301 Systems Programming at Green River College. The purpose of this assignment was to review Github forking and provide a light introduction back into algorithms (using Java).

`isUnique` is an algorithm that takes in a given string and returns `true` if all characters in the string are unique and `false` if they are not.

For example:
- "cat" would return `true`, as all characters in "cat" are unique.
- "catch" would return `false`, as the character "c" is occurs twice.

### How to Run the Project
This code can be run as-is with the IntelliJ IDEA IDE from Jetbrains, as long as [Java has been installed](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) locally.
